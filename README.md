# $Simulation of a 2-D Ising model with Metropolis and Wolff algorithms
monte carlo simulation of an ising model with different algorithms.

hi , this is my first time using github and since i have not seen any other repository showing how to implement the wolff algorithm on 
mathematica i thought  it could have been a good idea  to use this chance to learn github and give something back to the community. In the course of the next 
week i am going to add an analysis of the correlation times and a measure of few other quantities people can be interested into.

 15/07/18-initial commit:   added the fundamental implementation of the Metropolis algorithm and the wolff algorithm. To check the results of my simulations for each algorithm i plotted the equilibration time of the magnetizzazion for  2 different temperatures
