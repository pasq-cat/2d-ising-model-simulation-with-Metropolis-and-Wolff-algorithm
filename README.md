# 2d-ising-model-simulation-with-Metropolis-and-Wolff-algorithm
monte carlo simulation of an ising model with different algorithms.

hi , this is my first time using github and since i have not seen any other repository showing how to implement the wolff algorithm on 
mathematica it could have been a good idea use this chance to learn github and give something back to the community. In the course of the next 
week i am going to add an analysis of the correlation times and a measure of few other quantities people can be interested into.
